## [4.3.0] - The Async Engine Rewrite - 2026-07-16

### Added
- **BaseDownloader OOP Engine** -- All workers now inherit from a shared `BaseDownloader` class with built-in asyncio download queue, 3 concurrent download workers, retry logic, history tracking, and tag dispatch. Eliminates hundreds of lines of duplicated code across all 10 workers.
- **Asyncio Download Pipeline** -- Scrapers produce items into an `asyncio.Queue`; 3 parallel download workers consume from it. Downloads no longer block the scraper — API scanning and file downloads happen concurrently.

### Changed
- **All Workers Rewritten** -- `danbooru.py`, `gelbooru.py`, `konachan.py`, `nekos_best.py`, `nekos_life.py`, `rule34.py`, `safebooru.py`, `waifu_im.py`, `yande.py`, `zerochan.py` converted from procedural functions to OOP classes inheriting `BaseDownloader`.
- **User-Agent Header** -- Changed from Chrome browser UA (`Mozilla/5.0 ... Chrome/120.0.0.0`) to app-format UA (`RemGodCatcher/4.0 (by RemLover on GitHub)`). Fixes 403 Forbidden on Danbooru (which blocks browser UAs on API) and reduces Cloudflare flags on Nekos.best.
- **shared.py** -- Removed old per-site `get_session()` function. Session setup now lives in `BaseDownloader._setup_session()` with a single standardized UA for all workers. Added `asyncio` import and `BaseDownloader` class with `_async_download_file()`, `_download_worker()`, and `run_async_loop()`.
- **Zerochan API URL** -- Removed duplicate `p=1` parameter caused by embedding page number in both the URL query string and `params` dict. Parameters now sent cleanly via `params={"json": "1", "p": page, "l": 48}`. Fixes 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable from Cloudflare.
- **Mutable Default Argument** -- `send_tags()` default `artist_list=[]` changed to `artist_list=None` to prevent shared mutable state bugs.

### Removed
- **Old `get_session()` Function** -- Replaced by `BaseDownloader._setup_session()`.
- **Per-Worker Download Loops** -- Each worker no longer has its own download/retry/save/history code; all handled by `BaseDownloader`.

## [4.2.0] - The Danbooru & Hydrus Sidecar Update - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Danbooru Support** -- New worker, offline tag database (`dan_tag_names.json`), tag autocomplete endpoint, and Danbooru tab in the UI. Supports full tag search, rating filter (Safe/Sensitive/Questionable/NSFW), artist extraction, and video/image separation into subdirectories.
- **Hydrus Sidecar Files** -- New `write_hydrus_sidecar()` function auto-generates `.filename.txt` sidecar files for every downloaded image, containing tags, artists (prefixed with `creator:`), and source site. Configurable via `WRITE_HYDRUS_SIDECAR` in `.env` or the web UI config.
- **Gelbooru Danbooru-Style Rating System** -- Gelbooru rating dropdown now uses Danbooru short codes (`g`/`s`/`q`/`e`) with labels Safe/Sensitive/Questionable/NSFW and corresponding folder names.
- **Nekos.best & Nekos.life Hydrus Support** -- Both workers now call `send_tags()` after each download, generating Hydrus sidecar files with the category as the tag.
- **Waifu.im Tag Database** -- New `tags.json` with all 20 tags from the waifu.im API, sorted alphabetically, so the dropdown always shows the full list without relying on live API calls.

### Changed
- **Gelbooru Folder Naming** -- Rating subdirectories changed from `General`/`Sensitive`/`Questionable`/`NSFW` to `Safe`/`Sensitive`/`Questionable`/`NSFW` to match Danbooru convention.
- **Waifu.im Tag Dropdown** -- Removed placeholder "Select a tag" option; "Waifu" is now the first and default selected tag.
- **Main Tab** -- Removed the console log wrapper from the Main tab (it served no purpose there).
- **All Workers** -- Hardcoded retry limit `if dl_attempt < 2:` fixed to `if dl_attempt < dl_retries - 1:` so the user's configured `download_retries` is respected (affected 7 workers: rule34, gelbooru, waifu.im, safebooru, zerochan, nekos.best, nekos.life).

### Removed
- **Main Tab Console** -- Removed console-wrapper (clear button + log div) from the System Setup tab.

---

## [4.0.0] - Rem 4: The Theme & Visual Harmony Update - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Dark/Light Mode Wallpapers** -- Every tab now has dedicated dark (`_d.png`) and light (`_l.png`) wallpaper variants in `web/wallpaper/`, replacing the old single-format images.
- **Database Folder** -- Tag databases and user data (`safe_tag_names.json`, `yande_tag_names.json`, `tag_history.json`, `fav_tags.json`, `image_history.json`, `ui_config.json`) moved to a dedicated `database/` directory for cleaner project root.
- **UI Config API** -- New `/api/ui_config` endpoint saves and loads theme mode, wallpaper assignments, and color palette to `database/ui_config.json`.
- **Nekos.life Duplicate Guard** -- Worker now stops after 20 consecutive duplicates instead of looping forever on exhausted APIs.
- **Waifu.im Slug Fix** -- Tag names with spaces are now converted to hyphens (e.g. `genshin impact` becomes `genshin-impact`) for correct API queries.
- **Zerochan Session Config** -- Worker now creates a properly configured session with proxy and timeout settings.
- **Yande.re Ghost Thread Killer** -- Starting a new search now kills any old running thread, preventing ghost downloads.
- **Yande.re Download Timeout** -- Increased from 20s to 60s for large image downloads.
- **Yande.re Stop-Aware Retries** -- Retry loops now check the stop event, allowing instant cancellation.

### Changed
- **Glass-Morphism Light Theme** -- Reduced opacity of `--panel-bg` and `--input-bg` in the light theme for a true frosted-glass effect.
- **Light Theme Color Harmony** -- All hardcoded colors in History, Favorites, and Image Archive UI replaced with CSS custom properties (`--text-color`, `--accent-color`, `--border-color`, `--input-bg`, `--tab-active-bg`) for consistent theming.
- **Light Theme Default Colors** -- New default palette: Dark teal title (`#006b6b`), dark magenta accent (`#c400a4`) replacing the previous bright pink/purple for better readability on light backgrounds.
- **History Site Badge** -- Changed from hardcoded `#ff9ff3` to `var(--accent-color)` for theme-aware styling.
- **History Empty State** -- Changed from hardcoded `gray` to `var(--text-color)` with opacity.
- **Image Archive Cards** -- All hardcoded colors (`rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`, `#ff9ff3`, `#00d2d3`, `#ccc`, `white`) replaced with CSS variables for full light/dark theme support.
- **Image Tags** -- Favorite state tags now use `var(--accent-color)` for both background and text, with `var(--input-bg)` for non-favorite state.
- **MASTER_FOLDER** -- Now uses `BASE_DIR` instead of `os.getcwd()` for consistent path resolution across environments.
- **Rule34 Import** -- `rule34Py` import moved to module top level for cleaner initialization.

### Removed
- **Old Single-Format Wallpapers** -- Removed `.jpg` and single `.png` wallpapers from `web/wallpaper/`, replaced by dark/light mode pairs.
- **Root-Level Tag Databases** -- `safe_tag_names.json` and `yande_tag_names.json` removed from project root (now in `database/`).

---

## [3.2.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Yande.re Platform** -- New worker for yande.re (Moebooru API) with tag autocomplete, rating-based folder sorting (Safe/Moderate/NSFW), and local tag database (135k+ tags).
- **Download Retries Configuration** -- Retry count is now configurable in Options tab, saved to `.env` as `DOWNLOAD_RETRIES`.
- **Anti-Spam Pause** -- After 10 consecutive pages with no new downloads, a 5-second anti-spam pause triggers instead of flying through silently.
- **Rating Filter** -- Yande.re tab has a rating dropdown (All/Safe/Moderate/NSFW) that filters server-side and sorts into per-rating subfolders.
- **History Jump Button** -- Each search history entry now has a ➡️ button to navigate directly to the site's tab with the tag filled in.

### Changed
- **All Workers** -- Failed downloads are now retried up to N times (configurable) without stopping the queue.
- **Anti-Ban Pause** -- Pages with 0 new downloads skip the anti-ban pause, flying through already-downloaded content instantly.
- **Empty Page Limit Removed** -- Workers no longer stop after 3 empty pages; they continue until the API returns nothing.
- **Yande.re Anti-Ban** -- Uses the exact configured pause value (no random jitter).

---

## [3.1.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Nekos.life Category Type Indicators**: Categories are now visually grouped (GIF Only, Static Only, Mixed, Other) in the UI with a live type badge showing [GIF], [STATIC], or [MIXED] next to the dropdown.
- **Rule34 GIFs Only Filter**: New "GIFs Only" option in the Rule34 format dropdown to exclusively search for animated GIFs.
- **Favorite Item Remove Button**: Each favorite tag now has an "✕" button to quickly remove it without navigating to the site.
- **Jump-To-Site for All Platforms**: `jumpToSite()` now supports Zerochan, Waifu.im, Neko, and Nekos.life in addition to the original three booru sites.
- **Live Net Config Passing**: `startWorker()` now sends fresh values from the input fields for `api_timeout`, `retry_wait`, and `anti_ban_pause` instead of relying solely on the cached `globalNetConfig` object.

### Changed
- **Nekos.life Category Reorganization**: Dropdown options are now organized into `<optgroup>` sections for clearer browsing.
- **Tab Button Visibility**: Tab text color brightened from `rgba(255,255,255,0.7)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.9)` and hover state improved for better readability.
- **Favorite Tags UI**: The entire favorite card is no longer a single click target — only the tag/site text area triggers the jump, preventing accidental navigation when trying to remove a favorite.

### Removed
- **GIF Exclude Checkboxes**: Removed the separate "Exclude GIF" checkboxes from Safebooru and Gelbooru tabs. GIF filtering is now handled exclusively through the Format dropdown selector.

### Fixed
- **Image History Refresh**: `renderImageHistory()` is now called after toggling favorites, ensuring the Image Archive UI stays in sync.

---

## [3.0.0] - Rem 3: The Discovery & Archive Update - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Image Archive System**: A completely new UI in the frontend that creates individual cards for every downloaded image, displaying its filename, source site, clickable tags, and extracted artist names.
- **Favorites System**: Users can now heart tags in the History or Image Archive. These favorite tags appear in the Main Tab. Clicking a favorite tag instantly jumps to the corresponding site's tab and auto-fills the search input.
- **Search History Tracking**: Added a dedicated "History" tab with its own customizable wallpaper. It automatically records the latest searched tags across all sites (Rule34, Gelbooru, Safebooru, Zerochan, etc.) and limits the database to 500 entries to maintain high performance.
- **Background Tag Extraction**: Workers now intelligently parse massive tag lists and artist names directly from the APIs (`tag_string`, `tag_string_artist`, etc.) and send them to the backend without freezing the app.
- **Video & Format Filtering**: Implemented dedicated filters to exclusively search for Video formats (`.mp4`, `.webm`) or restrict searches to Images only across supported platforms.
- **Image History API**: New REST endpoints (`/api/image_history`, `/api/image_history/clear`, `/api/image_history/remove`) for managing the per-image tag archive.

### Changed
- **Cleaner Console Logs**: Removed verbose tag strings from the real-time console log. Logs now remain clean and readable, while tags are silently routed to the new Image Archive UI.
- **Safebooru Tag Parsing**: Fixed an issue where Safebooru hid its primary tags inside a `tag_string` variable instead of the standard `tags` array, ensuring accurate tag extraction.
- **Duplicate Tag Handling**: Improved backend logic to accurately differentiate between similar character tags and prevent duplicate entries in the JSON databases.
- **Scroll-Preserving History**: The History tab now preserves scroll position when new tags are added in real-time, preventing jarring jumps.
- **`.gitignore` Refined**: Replaced blanket `*.json` exclusion with specific filenames (`tag_history.json`, `fav_tags.json`, `image_history.json`) so project JSON files like `tags.json` are not ignored.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Options Tab** -- Renamed "API Keys" to "Options". Added configurable download settings (API Timeout, Retry Wait, Anti-Ban Pause) directly in the Web UI.
- **Waifu.im Tag Database (`tags.json`)** -- Local tag database with name-to-slug conversion. Typing "Genshin Impact" now correctly sends "genshin-impact" to the API.
- **Download Settings in `.env`** -- Added `API_TIMEOUT`, `RETRY_WAIT`, `ANTI_BAN_PAUSE` fields. All settings persist across restarts.
- **Safebooru Empty Page Breaker** -- Worker now stops after 3 consecutive pages with no downloads, preventing infinite loops on slow networks.
- **Rule34 Proxy Injection** -- Proxy settings are now injected into `rule34Py`'s internal session (`client.session.proxies`), so image downloads also go through the proxy.
- **Safebooru Parentheses Support** -- Parentheses in tag names (e.g., `rem_(re:zero)`) are now handled correctly via URL params instead of stripping them.

### Fixed
- **Rule34 API Key Format** -- Fixed `client.api_key` format. The library expects raw key string, not `&api_key=...` prefix.
- **Rule34 Image Download Proxy** -- Changed `requests.get()` to `client.session.get()` for image downloads, so proxy settings are applied.
- **Waifu.im NSFW Parameter** -- Changed `"True"` to `"true"` for `IsNsfw` parameter (API requires lowercase).
- **Waifu.im Empty Results** -- Now shows available tags when a tag doesn't exist, instead of generic "End of database reached".
- **Safebooru Cloudflare Handling** -- Improved error messaging for 403 responses.
- **Console Log Scrolling** -- Fixed flex layout so only the terminal area scrolls, not the entire page.
- **Options Tab Scrolling** -- Options tab content is now scrollable when it overflows.
- **Tab Display Mode** -- Changed from `display: block` to `display: flex` for proper height distribution.

### Changed
- **Console Font** -- Replaced JetBrains Mono with **Source Code Pro** (Google Fonts) for softer, eye-friendly terminal text.
- **Tab Name** -- "API Keys" renamed to **"Options"**.
- **Safebooru Worker** -- Added `page_downloaded` counter and `empty_pages` tracker to prevent infinite loops.
- **All Workers** -- Now read `api_timeout`, `retry_wait`, `anti_ban_pause` from `net_config` for configurable behavior.

### Removed
- **"Resting..." Log Message** -- Removed from Waifu.im worker to reduce log noise.
- **Parentheses Stripping** -- No longer removes `()` from Safebooru tags (they are valid and required).
